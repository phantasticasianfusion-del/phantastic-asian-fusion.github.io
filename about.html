      <h2>Our Phantastic Family Story</h2>
      <p>
        Phantastic Asian Fusion started as a simple family idea: share the
        Korean and Vietnamese flavors we grew up with at local festivals and
        pop-up events. What began as a small booth has turned into a family
        project where everyone has a role – from cooking and prepping, to
        running the tent, to greeting customers with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to bring comforting, street-style Asian food to our
        community in a fun, welcoming way. Every dish on our menu has a
        story behind it, whether it’s based on a family recipe, a favorite
        childhood snack, or a fusion twist we created together.

          <h3>Our Parents, Our Chefs</h3>
          <p>
            The heart of Phantastic Asian Fusion is our parents in the kitchen.
            From simmering broths to marinating bulgogi, they bring the
            flavors, techniques, and care they learned over the years into
            every batch of Seoul Street Fire Rice Cakes, Saigon Garden Rolls,
            and Phantastic Crepes.

          <h3>The Next Generation</h3>
          <p>
            The kids help with everything from prepping ingredients, to taking
            orders, to managing social media and design. Phantastic Asian
            Fusion is not just a business for us – it’s a way to learn, grow,
            and build something together as a family.

          <h3>Pop-Ups, Festivals & Community</h3>
          <p>
            You’ll often find us at local festivals, Asian cultural events, and
            community markets. We love creating a space where people can try
            something new, ask questions about the food, and feel like they’re
            part of our table.

          <h3>Our Dreams for the Future</h3>
          <p>
            As we grow, we hope to expand our menu, attend more events, and
            eventually move from a pop-up booth to a full food trailer or
            permanent spot. No matter how big we grow, we want to keep the
            same family energy and homemade taste that started it all.

      <h2>What “Phantastic” Means to Us</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Phantastic</strong> is more than a fun name – it’s how we
        describe the experience we want you to have when you visit our booth.
      </p>
      <p>
        For us, it means:
      </p>
      <ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 10px 0;">
        <li><strong>Family:</strong> Food made and served together.</li>
        <li><strong>Flavor:</strong> Bold, bright, and comforting dishes that stand out.</li>
        <li><strong>Fusion:</strong> Mixing Korean, Vietnamese, and other Asian influences in our own way.</li>
        <li><strong>Fun:</strong> A pop-up vibe that feels like a festival, not just a food line.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Thank you for supporting our family and for being part of our
        Phantastic journey. We can’t wait to cook for you at the next event.
